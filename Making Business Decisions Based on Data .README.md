Brief conclusion: <br>

During the A/B analysis we observed a steady rising of the revenue especially for group B which can be interpretated as a good sign.

Further calculations enabled us to identify the outliers. 

Statistical significance using the method Mann-Whitney confirmed that there were differences in conversion between groups A and B but no statistically significant differences were found in average order size between the groups.

Finally we can conclude that the A/B test is successful as we observed a stable and statistically significant increase in the conversion of visitors to buyers which therefore indicates a growth in revenue.
